ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @KARO93COM ðŸ‘‹

The purpose of my having a GitHub account is manifold: discovering it, getting used to its interface, testing tabs, practising repository creating/amending/deleting, making my own and intentionally purposeful mistakes so as to experiment and to understand both versioning and coding -- first alone, then as part of a team but without mistakes this time. More goals to come for sure as the topic is big.

I am not a technical person from start and believe I will not be either in the future. I aim at being independant enough to cope and take part in team projects. I am rather fond of having an overall view to understand user's needs and deliver accordingly.
