ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @KARO93COM ðŸ‘‹

The purpose of my having a GitHub account is manifold: discovering it, getting used to its interface, testing tabs, practising repository creating/amending/deleting, making my own and intentionally purposeful mistakes so as to experiment and to understand both versioning and coding -- first alone, then as part of a team but without mistakes this time. More goals to come for sure as the topic is big.

I am not a technical person from start and believe I will not be either in the future. I aim at being independant enough to cope and take part in team projects. I am rather fond of having an overall view to understand user's needs and deliver accordingly.

The languages I am to learn are:
- HTML5, CSS3, JS;
- PHP 8.2/8.3;
- SQL 8 -- with mySQL.
  
Others and later:  Bootstrap, Twig, Symfony, MVC pattern in a first time, and API obviously.
